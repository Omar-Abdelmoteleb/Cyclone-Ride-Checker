# Cyclone-Ride-Checker
A simple Python program that checks if a person is eligible to ride The Cyclone â€” the iconic wooden roller coaster at Coney Island, New York.  The program prompts the user for their height and ride credits, and then determines whether they meet the minimum requirements to enjoy the ride.
